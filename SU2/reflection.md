# Individual Reflection

The SU2 concept that was most challenging for me to implement was
channel richness. While the theory clearly states that complicated,
sensitive, or uncertain messages should be delivered through richer
channels like face-to-face conversations or phone calls, applying this
in practice was difficult. I instinctively chose email because it is
fast, convenient, and leaves a documented trail. However, during the
crisis simulation, this choice revealed a conflict between efficiency
and effectiveness. Using a lean channel for a high-stakes issue
increased the risk of misunderstanding and limited immediate feedback.

In the initial crisis communication, the core problem was the
misalignment between the complexity of the message and the communication
channel used. The internal email attempted to reduce uncertainty,
allocate responsibility, and reassure stakeholders simultaneously. In
SU2 terms, the channel did not support the intended function, which
created confusion and slowed collective understanding.

If this situation were real, I would organize a brief virtual meeting
with key stakeholders before issuing any written communication. This
would enable clearer interpretation, better emotional management, and
stronger alignment before formal statements are released.
